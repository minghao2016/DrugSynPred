CYP2C8	9606.ENSP00000360317	cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8; Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. In the epoxidation of arachidonic acid it generates only 14,15- and 11,12-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism the anti- cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol)
SOD1	9606.ENSP00000270142	superoxide dismutase 1, soluble; Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the cells and which are toxic to biological systems (By similarity)
ABCB1	9606.ENSP00000265724	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1; Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells
DCK	9606.ENSP00000286648	deoxycytidine kinase; Required for the phosphorylation of the deoxyribonucleosides deoxycytidine (dC), deoxyguanosine (dG) and deoxyadenosine (dA). It is also an essential enzyme for the phosphorylation of numerous nucleoside analogs widely employed as antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents
TLR9	9606.ENSP00000353874	toll-like receptor 9; Participates in the innate immune response to microbial agents. Detects the unmethylated cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs present in bacterial DNA. Acts via MYD88 and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response
CYP3A4	9606.ENSP00000337915	cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4; Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4- hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide
DNMT1	9606.ENSP00000352516	DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1; Methylates CpG residues. Preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA. Associates with DNA replication sites in S phase maintaining the methylation pattern in the newly synthesized strand, that is essential for epigenetic inheritance. Associates with chromatin during G2 and M phases to maintain DNA methylation independently of replication. It is responsible for maintaining methylation patterns established in development. DNA methylation is coordinated with methylation of histones. Mediates transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2. In  [...] 
SLC29A1	9606.ENSP00000360773	solute carrier family 29 (nucleoside transporters), member 1; Mediates both influx and efflux of nucleosides across the membrane (equilibrative transporter). It is sensitive (ES) to low concentrations of the inhibitor nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR) and is sodium-independent. It has a higher affinity for adenosine. Inhibited by dipyridamole and dilazep (anticancer chemotherapeutics drugs)
DCTD	9606.ENSP00000349576	dCMP deaminase; Supplies the nucleotide substrate for thymidylate synthetase
EGFR	9606.ENSP00000275493	epidermal growth factor receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral (v-erb-b) oncogene homolog, avian); Receptor for EGF, but also for other members of the EGF family, as TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, GP30 and vaccinia virus growth factor. Is involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Phosphorylates MUC1 in breast cancer cells and increases the interaction of MUC1 with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin
