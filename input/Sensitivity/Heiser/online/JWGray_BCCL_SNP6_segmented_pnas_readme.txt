The Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SNP6.0 data on breast cancer cell lines generated by the Joe Gray Lab at LBNL.

SNP Array and DNA copy number analysis Genome copy number was assessed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 analysis platform. 
Arrays were analyzed using aroma.affymetrix(1) (http://aroma-project.org), data were normalized as described(2) and DNA copy number ratios at 
each locus were estimated relative to a set of 20 normal sample arrays.  Data were segmented using circular binary segmentation (CBS) from the bioconductor package DNAcopy(3).
We used genome build HG18 for processing and annotating.

Raw data are available in The European Genotype Archive (EGAS00000000059), and were published in conjunction with Heiser, et al 2011 (PNAS).

This datafile can be visualized with the freely available software package called the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)
developed by the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/download).

The datafile is a tab-delimited text file that contains segmented genome copy number calls for 77 breast cancer cell lines.
The column headers can be interpreted as follows:

sample: cell line name
chromosome: chromosome number
start: start of segment (in bp)
stop: end of segment (in bp)
count: number of probes in the segment
mean: mean copy number for the segment (in log2 space)
